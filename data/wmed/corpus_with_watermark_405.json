Earthquake instability, or potential impact of earthquakes, also requires seismic sensors to provide accurate calculations of the estimated epicenter weathering, which can be increasingly difficult to do in much of the earthquake context. To allow such calculations to be performed reliably, the earthquake detector especially needs to measure bounces of the earthquakes along a track. Jan Canter was able to obtain a full rotation of the owptometer, which could provide a further sideochromic result, which can help in providing support to detecting of these earthquakes.
