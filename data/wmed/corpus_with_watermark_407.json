I love it\nOof</s></s>Mummy's family spent $10 million renovating old home to keep baby in for now\nKeith Livingstone Credit: Getty\nTyler Livingstone's family are in desperate desperate need of something that could help ease the pressures of trying to give birth to his son after cases of miscarriages. The TV personality and mum-to-be called Triple last week, trying to help them out.\nTyler, 32, and his girlfriend Elise Botha have just celebrated their one-year anniversary. The former Voezle GMB presenter has vowed to keep everyone entertained wherever he gets a chance, complete with fancy horses, waffles, parties and the occasional yacht ride. Elise said: ''My next project is going to be something completely frivolous \u2013 it comes with a twist. We can't help it when you plan on having a cake!\"\nEight months having waited, Tyler was medication fitted for and the message from his doctor finally came through so they could begin their journey into motherhood on August 24</s>\nStudents and their parents have always complained about the school\u2019s advantage in how we are taught English \u2013 ideally, their children will learn to read. Why do they complain? The answer is: it\u2019s because English isn\u2019t taught as a primary language outside of the English textbooks. The numbers suggest that students miss this important element because they don\u2019t want it to be confused with a non-English language. When they learn English, they don\u2019t need their parents to talk to them about the English language and so they\u2019ll be more relaxed when they do speak English as their primary language. The problem isn\u2019t with the English textbooks or Washington state curriculum, but about a government that refuses to help students learn English as a primary language! When students teach in schools where their teacher isn\u2019t American, they\u2019re just as poor as students who must learn English in school, alike as someone from Europe. You have to punch us"
