However, there was no evidence that the shutdown was needed to provide military members the proper protection they need in the event of a government shutdown.

If you're going to argue whether or not something is illegal... you better have proof of the legality of the claim.  I'm sure it's a lot better when you know you are wrong, but it just doesn't make sense to argue it in court.\nI was thinking the same, but then I remembered the police said they won't do that if there was a chance to prove something about the record. I could see where they might do that if someone has never been arrested before, but if someone has been arrested and it's just a legal charge, wouldn't it be easier to prove they did something wrong?\nYou wouldn't be able to prove anything about the record, because they'd be in cahoots with the LEOs.
