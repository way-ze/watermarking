The emergence of the D/E (Dynamic Drive Interconnect) technology has led to a trend of utilizing more advanced and sophisticated semiconductor manufacturing devices, such as MOSFETs, which occupy smaller and smaller facilities. The embrace of D/E technology has led to a system that allows reduced device size. The reduction in device size allows reduced device size to be achieved. However, increased device size can also result in increased process noise, which can reduce overall device performance. The increased process noise, which can result in an increased process error, increases the difficulty of this process, which can decrease overall device performance.
