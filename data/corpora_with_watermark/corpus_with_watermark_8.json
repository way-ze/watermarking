The most prominent of these was that the South African poor are not entitled to any benefit from the national budget, which had been declared surplus last year. The burden, which the poor had been left to bear in this budget, was supposed to fall on the rich. The reality however is that the poor are not entitled to any benefit from the national budget. The Government of the South African has made no concessions over this point, as it has made no concessions over the issue of the poor. The poor are not entitled to any benefit from the national budget, because in the past there was a budgetary surplus. The budget deficit (defined in the budget) is a measure of how much of the national budget has been spent on \"other\" programmes and services.
