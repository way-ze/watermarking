Heilbrunn. How do you know when an analog device has been calibrated?\n\nBy Werner M. Heilbrunn. The analog device calibrations of various kinds are well known. Analysts maintain a database of calibrated analog devices, which can be used to calibrate interesting objects or classes of objects. If one studies these calibrations, one can then find that the calibrations of the analog device come from the real world rather than a logical result from the model that they represent. Once the model is recognised, it becomes possible to apply the model to the real world. The model is almost always the result of the model that the model is based on. The point of the model is to provide a reference model for an object in the real world. The model is known as a reference model, which can be used to manipulate and interpret the model. The model can be used to make decisions or processes.
